<blockquote>
<p>Watch yourself and see: 90% of your energy is wasted in activity. And because of this, when the moment for action comes you don't have any energy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>フォーカス領域を決める。これ以外はやらない。</p>
<ul>
<li>筋トレ</li>
<li>ログ</li>
<li>開発</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Relaxation comes to you when there is no urge to activity; the energy is at home, not moving anywhere,</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>a creative person always goes on trying the wrong ways. If you always follow the right way to do a thing you will never be creative, because the "right way" means the way discovered by others,</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>The creative person has to dissolve all shoulds and should nots. He needs freedom and space, vast space; he needs the whole sky and all the stars.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Money is called currency—it should be a current. The moment you get it, spend it! Don't waste time, because that much time you are preventing the dollar from growing, from becoming more and more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>→お金 = currency = it should be a current</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Don't allow your life to become just a dead ritual.</p>
